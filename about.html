Manchester's first plant-based chimney cake bakery
Located in the heart of the city centre, YumYum is Manchester’s first bakery to serve the delicious ‘chimney cake’ which will be freshly baked in front of you every time. Oh, and what’s more, they’re completely vegan so can be enjoyed by anybody! </a>
<br>
<a>
What is a chimney cake?
Somewhere between a donut, croissant and a churro, the traditional European treat can be enjoyed on its own - coated in cinnamon sugar - or filled with a wide range of tempting treats including vegan and gluten free soft serve ice cream!</a>
<br>
<a>
Did you know... when removed from the cooking roll, smoke rises from its hollow centre, resembling a chimney. And that’s how it got its nickname!
what else will I find?
As well as tasty chimney cakes, you will find a variety of plant based treats including cinnamon rolls, macarons, loaded churros and waffles. Something for everyone! </a> </div>
<br>
<p>We know, we know. What good is a bakery without a coffee to wash it all down? Well, don’t worry. We’ve got you covered!
At YumYum, you will find the award winning, organic coffee beans - Tunki. This luxury, Peruvian coffee is the perfect accompaniment to any of our mouth- watering bakes.
But no matter what you choose to treat yourself to, you’ll always have the best quality, sustainable ingredients that put a smile on your face every time!</p>

<p>The people behind it all

Ariane and Hannah opened YumYum in 2022 with a like-minded vision of creating a friendly bakery serving a melting pot of delicious deserts.
Born in Brazil, Ariane moved to the UK to study English. After deciding to stay, she managed a steak house (YES, you heard that right). In 2014, Ariane turned vegan and developed a passion for creating indistinguishable plant based alternatives.
Originally from Sweden, Hannah moved to England to study International business. After more than 15 years’ experience in hospitality and catering, she has a love for food and all things creative. She is the driving force behind YumYum’s online content.
Together, this dream team have created a little slice of vegan happiness in the heart of the city.</p>
